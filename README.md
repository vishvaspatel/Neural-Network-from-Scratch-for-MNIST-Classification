# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-for-MNIST-Classification
This project involves implementing a feedforward neural network from scratch using Python to classify the MNIST dataset into 10 classes (digits 0-9). The model is built without relying on high-level deep learning libraries for architecture and training, focusing on implementing forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization manually.
